# Ulrik Strid

My name is Ulrik Strid, I'm a "full stack" developer from Sweden. Currently in a DevOps role working on everything from CI/CD and docker setup to backend and frontend services and up to architecture. I like open source and try to contribute where I can. My current focus on OSS has been to fill in gaps in web development using OCaml. I am one of 20 or so people to have built and certified a OpenID connect client.

From most recent (current) to least recet

- Xenit - As the first developer I've had a very varied role where I've doe everything from arcitecture to implementation of minor tools and automations and working with kubernetes.
- Sigma, MyTeam - Developer consultant leading frontend development.
  - I was in the "architect group" where we discussed architecture for the different projects we worked on and decided on technology we wanted to use going forward.
  - We did multiple "lunch and learns" where I talked about everything from React to ReasonML

## Projects

- Building and architecting the frontend and backend of a research tool in a small team of 2 developers.
  - We needed to build an image manipulation tool and ended up using WebGL which was challenging and needed a lot of RnD to land on.
  - The other big challenge was that we needed to do a lot of matrix calculations in the browser while still being responsive
- Designing (code) and implementing a OpenID connect provider for Swedish and Norwegian BankID.
- Created a customer portal with a very extendable arcitecture based on microservices.
  - It uses a GraphQL API to expose data to the client(s) and a mix of REST and gRPC to talk between services.
  - We're continually extending it with new services for both internal and external needs
- Lead developer/arcitecht for the the "control plane" of a security focused project to protect connected devices via "zero trust"
  - It's a fast moving project with a lot of moving parts which forces us to build a flexible platform
  - We're using MQTT heavily to talk to both the secure devices and the clients
  - We're leveraging the JOSE spec to create signed and encrypted messages depending on how much privacy is eneded
- Porting Lwt Unix from libev and "custom" C code to use libuv
